# SSGC-Portal-ActiveDirectory

Self Service Guest Creation Portal (SSGC Portal) is a tool built to create Temporary Guest accounts within Active Directory. We are using react + bootstrap on the frontend and Express and LDAP.js on the backend.

I also plan to implement a database to hold guest creation data. 

## Features
- Connect to Active Directory and create new guest account
- Automatically sets Account expiry date
- Displays guest account username and password out to user
- Frontend and backend Azure Authentication 
- Role management from Azure AD application
